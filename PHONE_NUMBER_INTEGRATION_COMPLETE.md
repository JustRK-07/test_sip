## What We Accomplished

### 1. âœ… Imported Existing Twilio Phone Number
- **Phone Number:** `+1XXXXXXXXXX`
- **Source:** Already purchased on Twilio account
- **Provider SID:** `PNxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
- **Trunk:** Already assigned to `TKxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
- **Status:** Successfully imported to database

### 2. âœ… Linked Phone Number to Campaign
- **Campaign:** Phone Number Test Campaign
- **Campaign ID:** `cmgjk3k1m0000sbll7wvbqgt4`
- **Agent:** `telephony-agent`
- **SIP Trunk:** `ST_YOUR_OUTBOUND_TRUNK_ID` (outbound)
- **Phone Number:** `+1XXXXXXXXXX` linked as caller ID

### 3. âœ… Made Successful Test Call
- **From (Caller ID):** `+1XXXXXXXXXX`
- **To (Lead):** `+919529117230`
- **Room:** `outbound-call-cf152147`
- **Dispatch ID:** `AD_YOUR_DISPATCH_ID`
- **Result:** Call initiated successfully âœ…

## How It Works

### Import Existing Twilio Numbers

```bash
# Fetches all phone numbers from Twilio and imports to database
node backend/test-import-twilio-numbers.js
```

**What it does:**
1. Connects to Twilio using credentials from `.env`
2. Fetches all purchased phone numbers
3. Imports them to database with proper associations
4. Links to tenant and platform trunk
5. Stores Twilio SID for future operations

### Link Phone Number to Campaign

```bash
# Links phone number to campaign and creates test lead
node backend/test-campaign-with-phone.js +919529117230
```

**What it does:**
1. Finds imported phone number in database
2. Creates or finds test campaign
3. Links phone number to campaign (for caller ID)
4. Creates lead with phone number to call
5. Displays complete configuration

### Make Test Call

```bash
# Makes outbound call using LiveKit
python test_outbound.py +919529117230
```

**What it does:**
1. Dispatches AI agent to LiveKit room
2. Creates SIP participant using outbound trunk
3. Initiates call to lead's phone number
4. Agent connects and handles conversation

## Database Schema Integration

### Phone Number Model

```javascript
PhoneNumber {
  number: "+1XXXXXXXXXX"          // E.164 format
  type: "LOCAL"                    // LOCAL, TOLL_FREE, MOBILE
  provider: "TWILIO"
  providerSid: "PNa636..."         // Twilio phone number SID

  // Relationships
  tenantId: "7c8693c6..."          // Links to tenant
  campaignId: "cmgjk3k1m..."       // Links to campaign (optional)
  livekitTrunkId: null             // Can link to LiveKit trunk (optional)

  // Status
  isActive: true
  purchasedAt: DateTime

  // Metadata
  metadata: JSON {
    capabilities: { voice: true, sms: true, mms: true }
    importedFrom: "twilio"
    originalTrunkSid: "TKb7dce..."
  }
}
```

### Campaign Integration

```javascript
Campaign {
  name: "Phone Number Test Campaign"
  sipTrunkId: "ST_YOUR_OUTBOUND_TRUNK_ID"    // Outbound trunk
  agentName: "telephony-agent"

  // Relationships
  phoneNumbers: [PhoneNumber]       // Linked phone numbers
  leads: [Lead]                     // Phone numbers to call
}
```

## Complete Call Flow

### Outbound Call with Caller ID

```
Campaign System
    â†“
Finds linked phone number: +1XXXXXXXXXX
    â†“
Dispatches AI agent to LiveKit room
    â†“
LiveKit Outbound Trunk: ST_YOUR_OUTBOUND_TRUNK_ID
    â†“
Twilio (using trunk TKxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)
    â†“
External Number: +919529117230 receives call
    â†“
Caller ID shows: +1XXXXXXXXXX âœ…
```

### Key Points
- âœ… Phone number imported from Twilio (already purchased)
- âœ… Phone number stored in database
- âœ… Phone number linked to campaign
- âœ… Outbound calls use phone as caller ID
- âœ… No hardcoded values - all database-driven

## API Support

### Import Phone Numbers via API

You can also import phone numbers programmatically:

```bash
POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenantId}/phone-numbers/import
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN

# Response: All Twilio numbers imported to database
```

### Query Phone Numbers

```bash
GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenantId}/phone-numbers
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN

# Returns: List of all phone numbers with associations
```

### Link Phone Number to Campaign

```bash
PUT /api/v1/tenants/{tenantId}/phone-numbers/{id}
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "campaignId": "campaign-id-here"
}
```
